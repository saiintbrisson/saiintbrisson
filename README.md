## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a self-taught software engineer, lifelong tinkerer and curious person. I learn by writing from (the complete) scratch, I like networks and distributed systems, but also kernel development and compilers. 

You might find interesting projects here, or contributions to several different FOSS projects. I take pictures. And listen to music, all the time. But I don't play anything, be it instruments or games, I'm terrible in all of them.

If your interests align, hit me up on Discord (`@pnc.luiz`) or email.
